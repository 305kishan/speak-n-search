## Voice Search Browser Automation Tool
Welcome to the speak-n-search repository! This tool allows users to perform web searches using voice input and automate browser actions. Currently, it is compatible with Windows machines and supports all major browsers. Future updates will aim to extend compatibility to Linux and macOS.
<br>
<br>

## How It Works
The tool consists of a Python script and accompanying batch file. Here's an overview of the workflow:
<li>Python Script: The Python script handles voice input processing and browser automation.
<li>Batch File: The batch file is used to execute the Python script and can be opened with custom keyboard shortcuts configured in Windows.
<li>Voice Input: Users provide search queries using voice commands.
<li>Browser Automation: The tool searches the provided query in the currently open browser window.
<li>Program execution stops when the user mentions anything related to shutdown, including words or sentences.
